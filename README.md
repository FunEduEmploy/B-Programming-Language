# B#-Programming-Language

A programming language built for more advanced coding.

This is the first version of it and its not much useful at the moment.

Note > For some reason, windows detects the program as a virus and I can't figure out why so if you see a message popup that the program might be a virus, click "more info" or however its called on your pc and run the program.
